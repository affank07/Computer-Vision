This project is implemented using Python and OpenCV to perform 'Bakcground image stitching and Image Panorama'. It consist of two task as follow:
1) Task 1: Performing background stitching using OpenCV and python, finding the features between the two images and matching them. 
Finding the homography and image warp of the second image using matched features and stitching them and also removing the foreground from the stitched image.
The images folder contains the images taken for background stitching and the result is saved in task1.png.
2) Task 2: Performing Image Panorama using OpenCV and python, matching features of multiple images and creating an overlapping matrix of the matched features.
The overlapping matrix tells us if the image will successfully overlap with the other image using feature matching.
Using the overlapping matrix creating a panorama by stitching multiple images according to the overlap of one image with another image.
The images folder contains the images taken for Image panorama and the result is saved in task2.png.
3) Task 3: Task 3 is also performing image panorama and to test on real time images taken from a cell phone.
The images folder contains the images taken for Image panorama and the result is saved in task3.png
