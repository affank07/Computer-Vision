1)Performing Face Detection using OpenCV and Python, multiple algorithms were used for face detection like Haar cascade, using a Deep neural network, and using HOG. 
The F1 score of each algorithm was calculated by using the result JSON file to select the best algorithm, F1 score of each algorithm is mentioned in the Report.pdf.

2) Performing Face clustering using OpenCV and Python, clustering of faces was done by using the Kmeans algorithm and the resulting clusters were obtained with faces 
of different celebs to their corresponding cluster. Each cluster was then displayed with its corresponding images, the results are in the Report.pdf.
