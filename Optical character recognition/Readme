This project is implemented using Python and OpenCV to perform 'Optical character recognition' from scratch, OCR is a technology used to extract text from images such as
images and documents. First, I took the templates which are the characters images and extracted their features using SIFT for feature matching. The 'CCL' (Connected component
labelling) was used to give each character in the test image a unique label and to also measure the bounding boxes of each of them. Finally, for each uniquely labeled 
character in the test image, the 'SSD' algorithm was applied for feature matching with the templates and to assign them their corresponding letter to the match with the 
minimum error.
